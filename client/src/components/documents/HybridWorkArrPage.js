      <h2>Hybrid Work Arrangement</h2>
      <p>
        Hybrid work arrangements may be used to allow staff members to fulfill
        some or all of their duties from an off-premise location. Enabling
        remote and hybrid work is a strategic business decision, in addition to
        being a benefit for staff members, and is consistent with our
        institutional goals, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Creating a highly engaged, equitable, diverse, and inclusive
          workforce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Attracting and retaining staff members by providing a work environment
          that is supportive, productive, and flexible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sustaining a highly collaborative culture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fostering an environment for continued productivity, improvement, and
          excellence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Empowering decisions that prioritize both business needs and staff
          member preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reducing our environmental impact and aligning with the organization’s
          sustainability goals.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For these reasons, our company encourages the use of remote and hybrid
        work arrangements and flexible scheduling when appropriate and when in
        alignment with the needs of the teams within business and work units.
        Approval for such arrangements is granted at the discretion of the
        business or work unit and is subject to ongoing and periodic review. The
        determination of staff member eligibility for remote and hybrid work
        will be made in accordance with this policy and the needs of the
        business or work unit. This policy applies to This policy applies only
        to staff from business and work units that participate in remote and
        hybrid work arrangements. It does not apply to staff from business or
        work units that do not participate in remote and hybrid work
        arrangements; nor does it apply to union members covered by a collective
        bargaining agreement. Position eligibility Business or work units are
        responsible for determining if positions are eligible to be remote or
        hybrid based on their operational and business needs. Typically, if all
        of the duties can be accomplished at an equal or higher level at an
        off-premise location, the position may be appropriate for either remote
        or hybrid work. If a significant portion (but not all) of the duties can
        be accomplished at an equal or higher level at an off-premise location,
        the position may be appropriate for hybrid work. The frequency of
        required on-premise work for a particular position will be decided by
        the appropriate manager. Expectations for timely completion of work,
        meeting attendance, responsiveness, and other performance criteria are
        the same for remote, hybrid, and on-premise staff members. Business or
        work units are expected to apply the same performance standards to staff
        members regardless of work location. Staff member eligibility Before
        determining if a staff member is eligible for remote and hybrid work,
        the business or work unit should first determine position eligibility
        (see Section II above). If a position is determined to be eligible, the
        business or work unit should next evaluate if a staff member can
        complete their job functions through a remote or hybrid work schedule.
        Consultation with HR is required when more than one staff member holds
        the same position but not all staff members have been determined to be
        eligible for remote and hybrid work. When evaluating remote or hybrid
        work eligibility, business or work units should consider specific
        position requirements, needs of the team, any existing performance
        concerns, and whether a staff member can optimally perform the job
        duties of the position while working off-premise. Additionally, business
        or work units must ensure that any proposed off-premise work
        arrangements are conducted consistent with applicable regulations and
        policies. Unless explicitly agreed to in writing, a remote or hybrid
        work staff member’s terms and conditions of employment are the same as
        those of on-premise staff, including required compliance with all
        company policies and applicable federal and state law while working off
        premise. Regardless of hybrid or remote work arrangements, staff members
        may be required to work from the office at any time at the sole
        discretion of their manager and managers should discuss such instances
        (e.g., hands-on training) with the staff member in advance whenever
        possible. Decisions regarding scheduling and attending meetings in
        person or virtually should be based on optimizing outcomes and not on
        personal preferences for remote work. Consequences of non-compliance
        Violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and
        including termination of employment. On-premise space requirements To
        accommodate on-premise work, business or work units should: Approach
        office and workstation design in a strategic manner, with a thoughtful
        mix of designated and flexible space. Provide team members with
        dedicated or shared workspace depending on business needs and individual
        staff members’ work arrangements. Provide collaborative work space for
        project teams. Allow space for individual and shared work items (e.g.,
        secure storage for personal belongings, workspace for physical network
        equipment, shared office supplies, special project supplies, etc.).
        Provide information on sustainable commuting and parking options.
        Technology requirements Internet Internet connectivity is the
        responsibility of staff members working off-premise. Bandwidth
        requirements may vary depending on job function and assignment. Standard
        IT services IT Services are the responsibility of the company. These
        services include central management of the laptop or other computer
        workstation, patching, anti-malware, firewall, and host-based security
        features. Services that require in-person assistance from IT Service
        Delivery must take place on premise. Equipment The organization will
        provide a computer and other necessary equipment required to perform
        essential job functions. Business or work units are not required to
        purchase multiple sets of equipment for hybrid work staff members.
        Hybrid meetings The organization will explore and implement technology
        solutions to allow staff members to meaningfully participate in meetings
        regardless of location. Data security Staff members are responsible for
        maintaining the security of data while working off-premise. Types of
        data include, but are not limited to, confidential company information,
        employee personal information. Staff members should protect such data
        through appropriate physical and electronic methods, such as the use of
        locked file cabinets/desks, use of password-protection, and other
        measures appropriate for the job duties and workspace. Additional
        information on working remotely can be found on the website. ADDITIONAL
        REQUIREMENTS Work schedules and timekeeping Regardless of work location,
        staff members are required to comply with organization’s Hours of Work
        policy. Working with family members at home Staff members should not use
        hybrid and remote work as a substitute for dependent care. Disability
        and accommodation Staff member requests for remote and hybrid work
        arrangements as an accommodation related to their own medical condition
        or sincerely held religious beliefs are handled through the
        accommodation process, which is managed by Equal Opportunity Access
        Office. Staff members should discuss concerns about
        accommodation-related questions with the EOA office or their HR
        Consultant. ADDITIONAL CONTACTS Equal Opportunity and Access Human
